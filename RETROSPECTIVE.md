# 2021 Retrospective
- The scoring did exactly what it intended
	- Use emojis to represent categories and/or bonuses?
- Important dates:
	- Registration: through Dec 31
	- Derby: Jan 1 - Jan 31
- Keep the guides simple deferring later guidance for later
	- Omit certain details from the Guides which can be announced later to thread subscribers.
- Raising contest awareness is the primary challenge
  - Determine a better strategy?  Ads?
	- Awareness threads should have been up front with disclaimers for their intended purpose, even if they included value-added discussions or surveys.
	- Seek strategy guidance from the community.
- Categorization must be as straightforward as possible
	- Registrations must target a single geeklist.
	- Creating interesting categories/accolades remains a challenge
		- Need to address the game duration issue to prevent the short games advantage
		- Create size categories (S = 30m, M = 60m, L = 90m, XL = 90+m)?
		- Create bonuses for meeting certain criteria?
		- Create categories for less popular games?
		- Target a single game, like Catan, for its own category?
		- What are some other useful ways to compute winners that doesn't simply afford more accolades to the frontrunners?  First to 10 players?  Or just use sizes?
- Communication involves a creators thread (Solomode) and a players thread (Derby)
	- The guides could have been authored as Google docs, allowing comments.  Both cover scoring.
	- Tell creators to take care to follow Derby and the associated Players' Guide once it's published since they need to be willing to help players through the process in their own threads.
	- Tell creators to subscribe to the main contest thread to be kept in the loop on important information and reminders.
- Disqualification should be practically impossible
	- You're automatically in provided your solo mode doesn't predate the contest announcement.  Everything else is just registration details.
	- Use the geeklist comment metadata to moderate/approve submissions rather than geekmail.
	- Disqualifications are dropped from the geeklist.
- Bonus cards and penalties
	- Bonus cards should not be overwhelmingly valuable, as to make someone with relatively few plays defeat a contestant with substantially more.  They should be like Barons in Railways.  They ought not count unless some minimum bar (# of plays or players) is met.  This aims to prevent unplayed solo modes from leading.
	- Bonus cards should diminish if multiples are pursuedâ€”e.g. 12 for 3, 10 for 2, 6 for 1.  In other words, each additional bonus is worth 2 less.
	- Penalties: if you don't play at least twice as many games (not ones you created) as you enter. Negative 10, per lacking play.
- Keep the registration open
	- Better to allow open registration from contest announcement until Derby begins.  The aim is increase visibility and interest.  And fewer channels with activity do that better than anything.
	- Allow up to 3 entries per contestant, but expect them to offer greater support by way of recorded plays.
- Forget prizes.
	- The competition, experience and feedback are a reward in themselves.  The sponsorship issue is a distraction.
- Deliverables:
	- Solomode Contest thread - posted Nov 1? Registration is effective immediately
		- Look at other contest lead times
		- How long does it take to ensure the right audience is aware of it?
	- Derby thread - initially posted about 4-5 weeks before Derby - Derby begins Jan 1
	- Submission Geeklist
	- Creators' Guide PDF
	- Players' Guide PDF
