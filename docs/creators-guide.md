# Solomode 2021 Creators' Guide
You want to create a solo mode.  This guide is tailored to solo mode creators.

## Important Dates
* Registration - **December 1 - December 14, 2021**
* Line Up - **December 17, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022**

Solomode is more journey than destination.  It affords an opportunity to wear your designer's cap.  You can create and iterate and fold valuable feedback into your creative process.

## Measuring Time
The host is monitoring time via the New York, EST time zone.  Recorded plays will be captured and measured via script in accord with the time of entries as appearing in BGG's api.

Take care to afford yourself a little buffer surrounding key dates.

## Derby
Solomode is a competition involving solo mode creators and players which culminates in **Solomode Derby**, the [scored race](./scoring-guide.md) over which which solo modes are spurred ahead by recorded plays.  The leaderboard is periodically updated so keen observers can watch it unfold until the final photo finish.

When the contest concludes accolades will be earned based on the final scores of submissions.  In each category there will be a winner and a runner up.  **If the category was sponsored and has at least 5 contestants** these individuals will be awarded prizes.  (Sponsorship will be clearly noted at the top of a category when and if it's sponsored.  Please see the details on international shipping in [Sponsors' Guide] if you're outside USA.)

Honorable mentions go to submissions played 5 or 10 times.  These will, respectively, appear on a nickel or a dime list.

## Line Up
Is the cut off by which registrations will have been confirmed.  While registration will be closed on December 14, some fixes may be in order.  Creators should mind their geekmail following registration close to ensure they are approved.

## What You Do
Over the course of the contest you
* develop solo modes,
* create, publish and update rules,
* enter your registration during **Registration**,
* play the solo modes of and offer feedback to your fellow competitors,
* moderate plays recorded in your thread(s) during **Derby**, and
* win accolades once **Derby** concludes.

## What You Deliver
For each solo mode you enter you must create a
* thread,
* rules, and
* registration.

The gap between Registration and Derby is a couple weeks.  Your development can and should precede all this.  In fact, except for Registration and Derby, nothing is bound by dates.  **You can create your thread and rules anytime after reading this notice**.  This enables you to be nearly done before any of the key dates—or holidays!—arrive.

### Thread
Create a thread.  It's your public relations channel.  You'll use it to share news, record plays, and accept audience feedback for your solo mode.
* It **must** be in the Variants forum of the board game your solo mode uses.
* As a signpost to [players](https://gist.github.com/mlanza/87c496848d63a989b57e9d15a5f53795), its title should begin "[Solomode 2021]" and be followed by the working title (updated at will) of your solo mode (e.g. "[Solomode 2021] Dark Days").  Conforming to this pattern reassures players they're in the right spot and helps ensure you earn every bit of credit you deserve.
* The opening post should include a link to the Players' Guide.  It reminds players how to properly record plays and why they should care.
* If digital platforms like [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com) make playing your solo mode possible you can explain how.
* You may record your own plays of your solo mode here if only to demonstrate what a properly recorded play looks like.  They won't be counted.
* If you wish to wrangle more play testers that you can get from this thread alone, you may extend an invitation in the [Derby Announcement](./announcement-derby.md) thread.

### Rules
Your solo mode rules
* **must** be linked from your thread's opening post by **Registration** end,
* **must** not have been released prior to Solomode 2021's announcement,
* **must** be yours (collaboration allowed),
* **must** not violate copyrights/laws,
* should include a solo mode title and playing time,
* should remind players to record plays over Derby so you earn credit,
* may include several files, and
* may require components and printables not included in the base game.

Reminding players in your rules to register their plays ensures this crucial detail won't be missed.  A game cannot be played, after all, without reading its rules.  As the Players' Guide describes the particulars of recording plays, linking to it saves you from offering a similiar explanation.

While you can publish rules anytime, take care as to when and how as a premature release might cause your most enthusiastic fans to peter out before scoring begins.  **Remember only plays recorded during Derby are scored.**

Although your working rules can be hosted anywhere over the duration of the contest, Solomode aims to get creators thinking in terms of shipping and publishing.  Please support the BGG community by publishing your final rules to BGG's file section by the time Derby concludes.

### Registration
Add a geeklist item to the desired category's geeklist.  These geeklists will be editable only during the registration period.
* The geeklist item **must** be of the `Thread` variety (a change from last year!)
* The submission **must** abide the constraints posed by the category (see its header).
* The Description for the geeklist item <!-- create a model example -->
  * should include an elevator pitch, and
  * **must** include its playing time as a range in minutes, all numbers in multiples of 5 (e.g. Playing Time: 30-45 minutes).
* While registrations will be given a final review once registration closes, you may receive official guidance via geekmail before then.  The host or a moderator will confirm your acceptance before the **Line Up** is announced.
* A submission may be eligible for multiple categories but a submission **must** not appear in more than one.  It is permissible to reposition a submission into another category prior to the close of registration.

## Design Tips
While there are no rules for creating your solo mode, please read [Pedersen's advice](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/37830/automa-approach-i-method-making-solitaire-modes-mu), especially his admonition to "Find the soul of the multiplayer experience."

Some designers, rather than create solo modes, used existing games as a canvas on which to create new solitaire experiences.  While this is allowed I suspect more players will prefer solo modes.

The benefit to solo modes is most of the base rules stand.  This helps keep solo mode rules shorter than new solitaire experiences.  And 2 pages of rules is certainly more inviting than 6.

## Competition Tips
Successfully competing is more than design.  It's presentation, communication, and public relations as well.

Most important perhaps are your solo mode's rules.  Not only do they equip a player for an experience, they are themselves an experience.  Mind every potential barrier and smooth away rough edges which might disincline a player from learning it.

Your biggest challenge is getting rules into people's heads.  This is preceded by the challenge of their wanting to get your rules into their heads.  If anything turned away would-be patrons last year, I suspect it was cumbersome rules, some of which resulted from creating solitaire experiences which did not preserve the soul of the multiplayer experience (mine made this blunder).

Patrons will peek in your shop and stroll to the next if it doesn't appear warm and inviting.  Baking cookies helps.  And if not that, teaching videos!

As you will be moderating your own threads, you need to understand the contest from the player's perspective.  Ensure you mind and understand the [Players' Guide](./players-guide.md).  Furthermore you're asked to support other creators which means you're going to be a player too anyway.

## Supporting Other Creators
Target playing about twice as many solo modes as you enter.  What every creator most covets is feedback.  Schedule time to learn and play solo modes and offer constructive feedback to your fellow competitors.

Early rulebook feedback is valuable too, even if end up not playing the game.  If a rulebook disinclines you to play, it may be helpful to explain why.

## Disqualifications
Most guidelines are meant to foster a consistent and positive user experience.  The rules most likely to disqualify—and there are few—are **marked in bold**.  **All routes which could lead to disqualification will be initiated via geekmail.**

Mind your geekmail especially in the gap between end of Registration and Line Up.  Mark your calendars so you don't forget.  You must respond to issues within this critical window.  Once you clear this hurdle you can rest easy.  You've made it!

The contest host reserves the right to fix, interpret, clarify, arbitrate, and enforce the contest rules as he sees fit.
