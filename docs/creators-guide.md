# Solomode 2021 Creators' Guide
You want to create a solo mode.  This guide is tailored to solo mode creators.

## Important Dates
* Registration - **December 1 - December 14, 2021**
* Line Up - **December 17, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022**

[Solomode](./announcement-solomode.md) is more journey than destination.  It affords an opportunity to wear your designer's cap.  You can create and iterate and fold valuable feedback into your creative process.

Mind your geekmail **especially in the gap between end of Registration and Line Up**.  Mark your calendars so you don't forget.  You must respond to issues within this critical window.  Once you clear this hurdle you can rest easy.  Your solo mode has been successfully entered into the Line Up!

## Measuring Time
The host is monitoring time via the New York, EST time zone.  Recorded plays will be captured and measured via script in accord with the time of entries as appearing in BGG's api.

Take care to afford yourself a little buffer surrounding key dates.

## Derby
Solomode is a competition involving solo mode creators and players which culminates in [Derby](./announcement-derby.md), a [scored race](./scoring-guide.md) over which which solo modes are spurred ahead by recorded plays.  The leaderboard is periodically updated so keen observers can watch it unfold until the final photo finish.

When the contest concludes accolades will be earned based on the final scores of submissions.  In each category there will be a winner and a runner up.  **If the category was sponsored and has at least 5 contestants** these individuals will be awarded prizes.  (Sponsorship will be clearly noted at the top of a category when and if it's sponsored.  Please see the details on international shipping in the [Sponsors' Guide](./sponsors-guide.md) if you're outside USA.)

Honorable mentions go to submissions played 5 or 10 times.  These will, respectively, appear on a nickel or a dime list.

## Line Up
Shortly after **Registration** ends, the line up of solo modes will be announced.  The "line up" is just the list of competing solo modes, by category.  Each submission will race against other submissions in the same category.

## What You Do
Over the course of the contest you
* develop solo modes,
* create, publish and update rules,
* enter your registration during **Registration**,
* play the solo modes of and offer feedback to your fellow competitors,
* moderate plays recorded in your thread(s) during **Derby**, and
* win accolades once **Derby** concludes.

## What You Deliver
For each solo mode you enter you must create a
* thread,
* rules, and
* registration.

The gap between Registration and Derby is a couple week.  Don't dilly dally. **You can create your thread and rules anytime after reading this notice**.  This way your submissions will be approaching done by the time Registration—and the holidays!—arrive.

### Thread
Create a thread.  It's your public relations channel.  You'll use it to share news, record plays, and accept audience feedback for your solo mode.
* It **must** be in the Variants forum of the board game your solo mode uses.
* Its title should begin **[Solomode 2021]** and be followed by the working title (updated at will) of your solo mode. **[Solomode 2021] Dark Days**, for example.  Conforming to this pattern is a signpost to players that they're in the right spot to record their plays.  It aims to get you every bit of credit you deserve.
* The opening post should request that visitors who want to support your solo mode review the [Players' Guide](./players-guide.md) in preparation for [Derby](./announcement-derby.md).  Note its dates as a reminder of the very important when.
* If digital platforms like [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com) make playing your solo mode possible, explain how.
* You may record your own plays of your solo mode here if only to demonstrate what properly recorded plays look like.  They won't be counted.
* To wrangle early play testers via another channel, you may extend an invitation in the [Derby Announcement](./announcement-derby.md) thread directing them into your thread.

### Rules
Your solo mode rules
* **must** not have been released prior to the date of [this announcement](./announcement-solomode.md),
* **must** not violate copyrights/laws,
* should be linked from your thread's opening post,
* should include a solo mode title and playing time,
* should remind players to record plays over Derby so you earn credit,
* may be the product of collaboration,
* may include multiple files, and
* may require components and printables not included in the base game.

Reminding players in your rules to "record plays over Derby" improves the odds this crucial detail won't be forgotten.  A game cannot be played, after all, without reading its rules.  Cite and link the [Players' Guide](./players-guide.md) if you like.

While you can publish rules anytime, take care to remind your audience that **only plays over Derby are scored**.  Ask them to conserve some enthusiasm and energy for the main event.

Although your working rules can be hosted anywhere over the duration of the contest, Solomode aims to get creators thinking in terms of shipping and publishing.  Please support the BGG community by publishing your final rules to BGG's file section by the time Derby concludes.

### Registration
Add your submission (a geeklist item) to the [Line Up](./categories.md).  These geeklists will be editable **only during the registration period**.
* The geeklist item **must** be of the `Thread` variety.  This is a change from last year!
* The submission **must** abide the requirements posed by the category.  The requirements appear in the category header.
* The Description for the geeklist item <!-- create a model example -->
  * should include an elevator pitch, and
  * **must** include the playing time as a range **in minutes**, all numbers in multiples of 5.   **Playing Time: 30-45 minutes**, for example.
* A submission may be eligible for multiple categories but it **must** not appear in more than one.  Your category is committed once you register.  If you're not sure which category you prefer, defer your decision.
* Your rules **must** be linked from your thread's opening post.
* Your thread's title **must** conform to the prescribed pattern:  **[Solomode 2021] Dark Days**

Your registration will be reviewed within **3 days** of entry.  **Mind your geekmail and respond promptly to ensure your registration clears.**  Your submission will be checked against all listed **musts**.  Once it clears, that hurdle's behind you.  Take a break and enjoy the holidays.

## Design Tips
While you can create any kind of solo mode you like, please read [Pedersen's advice](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/37830/automa-approach-i-method-making-solitaire-modes-mu), especially his admonition to "Find the soul of the multiplayer experience."

Some designers, rather than create solo modes, used existing games as a canvas on which to create solitaire experiences.  While this is allowed I suspect more players will prefer solo modes.

The benefit to solo modes is most of the base rules stand.  This helps keep solo mode rules shorter than new solitaire experiences.  And short rules are certainly more inviting.

## Competition Tips
Successfully competing is more than design.  It's presentation and communication as well.

Most important perhaps are your rules.  Not only do they equip a player for an experience, they are themselves an experience.  Mind every potential barrier and smooth away rough edges which might disincline a player from learning it.

Your biggest challenge is getting rules into people's heads.  This is preceded by the challenge of their wanting to get your rules into their heads.  Those who provide the best on ramp will have a distinct advantage.  If anything turned away would-be patrons last year, I suspect it was cumbersome rules, some of which resulted from creating solitaire experiences which did not preserve the soul of the multiplayer experience.  I made this blunder myself.

Patrons will peek in your shop and stroll to the next if it doesn't appear warm and inviting.  Baking cookies helps.  And if not that, teaching videos!

As you will be moderating your own threads, you need to understand the contest from the player's perspective.  Ensure you mind and understand the [Players' Guide](./players-guide.md).  Furthermore you're asked to support other creators which means you're going to be a player too anyway.

## Supporting Other Creators
Target playing about twice as many solo modes as you enter.  What every creator most covets is feedback.  Schedule time to learn and play solo modes and offer constructive feedback to your fellow competitors.

Early rulebook feedback is valuable too, even if you end up not playing the game.  If a rulebook disinclines you, describing the rough edges from your perspective may be a help.

## Disqualifications
Most guidelines are meant to foster a consistent and positive user experience.  The critical rules include emboldened words like "**must**."  **All routes which might lead to disqualification will be initiated via geekmail.**  So mind your geekmail over other channels.

*The contest host reserves the right to fix, interpret, clarify, arbitrate, and enforce the contest rules as he sees fit.*
