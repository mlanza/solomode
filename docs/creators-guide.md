# Solomode 2021 Creators' Guide
You want to create a solo mode.  This guide is tailored to solo mode creators.

## Important Events
* Registration - **December 1 - December 14, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022** (plays are scored only in this month)

## Derby
Solomode is a competition involving solo mode creators and players which culminates in **Solomode Derby**, a [scored race](./scoring-guide.md) over which which solo modes are spurred ahead by tallied solo mode plays.  The leaderboard is periodically updated so keen observers can watch it unfold until the final photo finish.

## What You Do
Over the course of the contest you
* develop solo modes,
* create, publish and update rules,
* enter your registration during the **Registration** dates,
* play the solo modes of and offer feedback to your fellow competitors,
* moderate plays recorded in your thread(s) during the **Derby**, and
* win accolades once the **Derby** concludes.

<!-- Also, subscribe to moderation thread if you want to be kept in the loop on important discussions, updates and reminders. -->

## What You Deliver
For each solo mode you enter (1 per event at most) you must create a
* thread,
* rules, and
* registration.

Your solo mode (thread and rules) can be published and updated at any time.  This means—assuming you're exceptionally eager!—you could even begin today.  Be forewarned: the contest is for new solo modes.  Previously created solo modes (even if updated for the contest) will be disqualified.

While Derby is the big event, your means to scoring, Solomode is more journey than destination.  You're afforded an opportunity to create and iterate and to fold valuable feedback into your creative process.  Giving and getting feedback is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of participating.

<!--Your thread and entry constitute a registration and **must** be created during the **Registration** period.  Once you've cleared registration all you have left is to publish your rules and await players.  Hopefully, they'd been eagerly awaiting your release and had already subscribed to your thread!  In the meantime, you're encouraged to play and review solo modes—the rule of thumb is twice as many entries as you entered.-->

### Thread
Create a thread.  This is your PR channel.  You'll use it to share news and, ultimately, accept votes and audience feedback for your solo mode.
* It **must** be in the Variants forum of the board game your solo mode uses.
* As a signpost to [players](https://gist.github.com/mlanza/87c496848d63a989b57e9d15a5f53795), its title should begin "[Solomode 2021]" and be followed by the working title (updated at will) of your solo mode (e.g. "[Solomode 2021] Ticket to a Roadtrip").  Conforming to this pattern reassures players they're in the right spot and helps ensure you earn every bit of credit you deserve.
* The opening post should include a link to the Players' Guide.  You should direct players to this guide to ensure they understand how their votes are scored.

### Rules
Your solo mode rules
* **must** be hosted on BGG (file section, inline text, etc.),
* **must** be a first edition (a new creation),
* **must** be yours (collaboration allowed),
* **must** not violate copyrights/laws,
* should be easy to locate from your thread (the opening post is recommended),
* should implore players to register plays so you earn credit,
* may include several files, and
* may require components and printables not included in the base game.

Reminding players in the rulebook to register their plays ensures this important detail won't be missed.  A game cannot be played, after all, without reading its rules.  And even better if you link to the Players' Guide—again!  The Players' Guide saves you from having to explain how Derby works.

While you can publish rules anytime, give some care as to when and how as a premature release might cause your biggest fans to peter out before **Derby** begins.  **Remember only Derby plays are scored.**

### Registration
Add a geeklist item to a __single__ geeklist (event category).  The geeklists will be editable only during the prescribed regitration period.
* The geeklist item **must** be of the `Thread` variety (a change from last year!)
* The solo mode **must** abide the constraints posed by the category.  These are specified in the geeklist header for the chosen category.
* The Description for the geeklist item should include an elevator pitch and an average playing time.

A bit more on rules.  Not only does a rulebook offer an experience, it is an experience.  Is it daunting?  Hard to digest?  Does it require hard-to-source components, necessitate a good amount of printing/assembly, or use odd paper sizes?

This is a contest and, as such, involves more than just solo mode design.  You have to mind how your solo mode will be received and smooth away whatever rough edges which might disincline a player from learning it.

Your biggest challenge is getting rules into people's heads and getting them to want to get the rules into their heads.  Understand that would-be patrons may, after peeking in, meander over to the next shop if yours isn't warm and inviting.  I'm told baking cookies helps!

## Moderation
To ensure a safe ride the host or a moderator will review entries and report issues.  Mind your geekmails.  As long as you respond and make corrections within **5 days** you have no need to worry about inadvertently being disqualified.  You'll get the guidance you need.

The contest host reserves the right to fix, interpret, clarify, arbitrate, and enforce the rules as he sees fit.
