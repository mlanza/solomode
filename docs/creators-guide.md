# Solomode 2021 Creators' Guide
You want to create a solo mode.  This guide is tailored to solo mode creators.  

## Important Dates
* Registration - **December 2021**
* Derby - **February 2022** (plays are scored only in this month)

## Derby
Solomode is a competition involving solo mode creators and players which culminates in **Solomode Derby**, a [scored race](./scoring-guide.md) over which which solo modes are spurred by tallied solo mode plays.  The leaderboard is periodically updated so keen observers can watch it unfold until the final photo finish.

## What You Do
Over the course of the contest you
* develop solo modes,
* register them during **Registration**,
* publish your solo mode rules any time before the **Derby** arrives,
* moderate plays registered into your thread(s) during the **Derby**, and
* win accolades and collect prizes once the **Derby** concludes.

Also, subscribe to moderation thread if you want to be kept in the loop on important discussions, updates and reminders.

## What You Deliver
For each solo mode you enter (2 at most!) you must create a
* thread, 
* entry, and 
* rulebook.  

Your thread and entry constitute a registration and **must** be created during the **Registration** period.  Once you've cleared registration all you have left is to publish your rules and await players.  Hopefully, they'd been eagerly awaiting your release and had already subscribed to your thread!  In the meantime, you're encouraged to play and review solo modes—the rule of thumb is twice as many entries as you entered.  Getting reviews is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of creating.

### Thread
Create a thread.  This is where you'll share news and, ultimately, accept votes and audience feedback for your solo mode.
* It **must** be in the Variants forum of the board game your solo mode uses.
* As a signpost to [players](https://gist.github.com/mlanza/87c496848d63a989b57e9d15a5f53795), its title should begin "[Solomode 2021]" and be followed by the working title (updated at will) of your solo mode (e.g. "[Solomode 2021] Ticket to a Roadtrip").  Conforming to this pattern helps players register plays in the right spot and earns you all the credit you deserve.
* The opening post should be a customized copy of this opening post.

### Entry
Create an entry (a geeklist item) for your solo mode inside a __single__ category (a geeklist). 
* The geeklist item 
  * **must** be of the `Board Game` variety.
  * **must** be for the board game in which your thread exists.
* The Description for the geeklist item
  * **must** link (using [thread=n]) to the respective thread.  This doorway is a key access point to your solo mode!
  * should include an elevator pitch and a playing time.
* The solo mode **must** abide the constraints posed by the category.

### Rulebook
Your solo mode rulebook
* **must** be released to your thread (e.g. directly or by hyperlink) before the **Derby** begins,
* **must** be a first edition,
* **must** be your creation, citing collaborators if applicable,
* **must** not violate copyrights/laws,
* should be *easily discoverable* (e.g. hyperlinked to a safe, reputable host) from your thread,
* should for posterity, by contest conclusion, be published to the respective BGG file section (update your hyperlink!),
* should implore players to register plays (hyperlink to the Solomode Player's guide) so you can earn credit,
* may include several files, and
* may require components and printables not included in the base game.

By reminding players to register plays in your rulebook—since rules must be read!—you'll ensure that detail won't be missed.  And it means you won't have to bother explaining it in your thread.

While you can publish rules anytime once you've registered, give some care as to when and how as a premature release might cause eager players to peter out before the **Derby** begins.  Recall that plays happening outside the derby score nothing.

A word on rulebooks.  Not only does a rulebook offer an experience, it is an experience.  Is it daunting?  Hard to digest?  Does it require hard-to-source components, necessitate a good amount of printing/assembly, or use odd paper sizes?

This is a contest and, as such, involves more than just solo mode design.  You have to mind how your solo mode will be received and smooth away the rough edges which might disincline a player from learning it.  

Your biggest challenge is getting rules into people's heads and getting them to want to get the rules into their heads.  Understand that would-be patrons may, after peeking in, meander over to the next shop if yours isn't warm and inviting.  I'm told baking cookies helps!

## Host & Deputy Moderation
To ensure a safe ride a moderator will review entries and report issues.  Mind your geekmails.  As long as you respond and make corrections within **5 days** you have no need to worry about inadvertently being disqualified.  You'll get the guidance you need.

If you have a strong handle on the contest requirements please consider volunteering to be a deputy moderator for the entries in any one category.  You would guide contestants through fixing any problems with their entries and report any irreconcilable issues or ambiguities to me.

The contest host reserves the right to fix, interpret, clarify, arbitrate, and enforce the rules as he sees fit.
