# Solomode 2021 Players' Guide

You want to play newly created solo modes.  This guide is tailored to solo mode players.

Reading Time: 5 minutes

## Important Events
* Line Up - **December 15, 2021** (contest registration is final)
* Derby - **January 2022** (the time over which your efforts reap the greatest reward)

## Solomode
Solomode is a competition in which amateur designers create and share solo modes.  It culminates in Solomode Derby, a month over which recorded plays score points for solo mode authors.  This guide explains how to record plays.  But for these there would be no Solomode.

## What You Do
Once the **Line Up** of solo modes goes up you
* seek out those which interest you,
* learn the rules,
* play them, and
* record the fact!

*Not owning a game may not necessarily be a hinderance.  Where possible games may be played on [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com).*

### Recorded Plays
When you play a solo mode it needs to be recorded so that, for contest purposes, it can be scored.  You register a play by making a post.  The post must contains a **tallyword**.  It may contain **comments**.

A tallyword is any of LIKE, LUMP or LOVE in all caps and which appears by itself on the first line.  It signals enthusiam resulting from the play and, more importantly, helps a bot differentiate it from other chatter in the thread.  It's what enables points to be periodically added to public scoreboards.

If points are the mash, comments are the gravy.  You may (and should) use the remainder of the post to recap your experience and/or provide useful feedback.  It's your best means of expressing appreciation to solo mode creators.

It can't be overstated.  Recorded plays are as the harvest to the farmer, the fuel on which the contest runs.  Please register discrete plays separately.  Every play matters and should be properly accounted for.

*Solo mode authors may register plays for their own solo modes.  They won't be scored.*

### Where Matters
Where you register a play determines who, if anyone at all, earns credit.  Take care to target Solomode threads.  Find threads for solo modes in the following categories/geeklists:

*
*

These threads are hubs in which authors engage players.  They're used to announce updates, release rules and, most importantly, record plays.  To be kept in the loop, subscribe to those which interest you and once you've played a solo mode don't forget to register it.  Even if you have no comments to add it improves someone's score.

### When Matters
You may record plays anytime but only those recorded during **Derby** earn points for their creators so, to make the most of your effort, plan accordingly.

Plays **must** be recorded in the month in which they actually occurred.  That is, if you record one in December the implication is it took place in December and not January.  The intent is to prevent play testers from carrying old plays forward as this'd afford a greater scoring window to creators who release early.  It would unintentionally pressure everyone else to do likewise.

### Early Access
Solo mode creators may announce works-in-progress (in this thread or elsewhere) and invite you to try versions well in advance of the official registration.  While your plays in the development stage may be recorded and are no doubt appreciated, they won't be scored.  Save some enthusiasm for Derby.

### Prompted Fixes
If you mess up in registering your play a moderator or the creator may invite you to fix your post.  Please respond promptly to ensure your points are correctly recorded.

### Recap
A recorded play is a post to a solo mode thread whose first line is a tallyword (LIKE, LUMP or LOVE) and which may or may not have comments.  Each such post should correspond to a _single play_ which took place within the month in which it was recorded.  As recorded plays are Solomode's currency, they're eagerly anticipated, highly coveted and sincerely appreciated.
