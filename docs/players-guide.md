# Solomode 2021 Players' Guide

You want to play newly created solo modes.  This guide is tailored to solo mode players.

Reading Time: 5 minutes

## Important Dates
* Line Up - **January 1, 2022** (solo mode registry is final)
* Derby - **February 2022** (the time over which your efforts reap the greatest reward)

## Solomode
Solomode is a competition in which amateur designers create solo modes for solo mode players to enjoy.  It culminates in Solomode Derby, an month over which every registered play earns its author points and improves his position on the scoreboard.  This guide explains how to register plays.

But that's not everything.  Solomode players have their own scoreboard!  So it's not only authors who climb scoreboards.  You can compete for your own place and prize [if you're incentivized to do so](./scoring-guide.md)â€”or just play casually.  But for the good of authors, your participation is greatly appreciated.

## What You Do
Over the course of the contest you
* discover (and subscribe to!) interesting solo mode once the final **Line Up** is revealed,
* learn rules,
* play solo modes, and
* register plays.

*Not owning a game is not always a hinderance.  Many games are solo mode playable on [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com).*

### Registered Plays
When you play a solo mode it needs to be recorded so that, for contest purposes, it can be scored.  You register a play by making a post.  The post must contains a **tallyword**.  It may contain **comments**.

A tallyword is any of LIKE, LUMP or LOVE in all caps and which appears by itself on the first line.  It signals enthusiam resulting from the play and, more importantly, helps a bot differentiate it from other chatter in the thread.  It's what enables points to be periodically added to public scoreboards.

If points are the mash, comments are the gravy.  You may (and should) use the remainder of the post to recap your experience and/or provide useful feedback.  It's your best means of expressing appreciation to solo mode creators.

It can't be overstated.  Registered plays are as the harvest to the farmer, the fuel on which the contest runs.  Please register discrete plays separately.  Every play matters and should be properly accounted for.

*Solo mode authors may register plays for their own solo modes.  They won't be scored.*

### Where Matters
Where you register a play determines who, if anyone at all, earns credit.  Take care to target Solomode threads.  You'll know you're in one if the title starts "[Solomode 2021]", similar to this one (click here).

These threads are hubs in which authors engage players.  They're used to announce updates, release rules and, ultimately, collect registered plays.  To be kept in the loop, subscribe to ones which interest you and once you've played a solo mode don't forget to register it.  Even if you have no comments to add it improves someone's score.

You can discover solo mode threads by visting the geeklists/menus for this year's contest. 

### When Matters
You may register plays anytime but only those registered during the **Derby** earn points for their creators so, to make the most of your effort, plan accordingly.

Plays **must** be registered in the month in which they actually occurred.  That is, if you register one in February the implication is it took place in February and not January.  The intent is to prevent play testers from carrying old plays forward as this'd afford a greater scoring window to creators who released early.  It would unintentionally pressure everyone else to do likewise.

### Recap
A registered play is a post to a solo mode thread whose first line is a tallyword (LIKE, LUMP or LOVE) and which may or may not have comments.  Each such post should correspond to a _single play_ which took place within the month in which it was registered.  As registered plays are Solomode's currency, they're eagerly anticipated, highly coveted and sincerely appreciated.
