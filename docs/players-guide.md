# Solomode 2021 Players' Guide

You want to play newly created solo modes.  This guide is tailored to solo mode players.

## Important Dates
* Line Up - **December 17, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022**

## Solomode
[Solomode](./announcement-solomode.md) is a competition in which fledgling or experienced designers create and share solo modes.  It culminates in [Derby](./announcement-derby.md), a month over which recorded plays score points for solo mode creators.  This guide explains how to record plays.

## What You Do
From the [Line Up](./categories.md) you
* seek out solo modes,
* learn their rules,
* play them (esp. during Derby!), and
* record the fact.

Creators are free to use digital platforms to make their solo modes more widely available.  This may make available games you don't physically own.

### Recording Plays
When you play a solo mode it needs to be recorded so that, for contest purposes, it can be scored.  You register a play by making a post.  The post must contains a **tallyword**.  It may contain **comments**.

**A tallyword is any of LIKE, LUMP or LOVE in all caps and which appears by itself on the first line of your post.**  It signals your enthusiam and, more importantly, helps a bot differentiate it from other chatter in the thread.  It's what enables points to be periodically added to public scoreboards.

If points are the mash, comments are the gravy.  You may (and should) use the remainder of the post to recap your experience and/or provide useful feedback.  It's your best means of expressing appreciation to solo mode creators.

As recorded plays are Solomode's currency, they're eagerly anticipated, highly coveted and sincerely appreciated.  You can play a solo mode as many times as you like.  Just take care to record each play in a separate post.

### Where Matters
Where you register a play determines who, if anyone at all, earns credit.  Take care to target Solomode threads.  They can be reached via [category geeklists](./categories.md) but ensure you're recording plays in the threads belonging to the solo mode you played.  When you land in one its opening post should make it crystal clear you're in the right place.

These threads are hubs in which creators engage players.  They're used to announce updates, release rules and, most importantly, record your plays.  To be kept in the loop, subscribe to whichever threads interest you and once you've played a solo mode **please don't forget to record it**.  Even if you make no comments somebody's score depends on it.

### When Matters
You may record plays anytime but only those recorded during **Derby** earn points for creators so, to make the most of your effort, plan accordingly.

Plays **must** be recorded in the month in which they actually occurred.  That is, if you record one in January the implication is it took place in January and not December.  The intent is to prevent play testers from carrying old plays forward as this'd afford a greater scoring window to creators who release early.  It would unintentionally pressure others to do likewise.

### Corrections
If you fail to properly record a play someone may prompt you to correct your post.  Please respond promptly to ensure your points are awarded to the creator.

### Players' Scoreboard
If you're not interested in competing against other players skip this bit.

In addition to tracking the scores of submissions during Derby, players will [earn scores](./scoring-guide.md) on a scoreboard maintained in this thread.  **If the Players' Scoreboard is sponsored** the winner and runner up will be awarded prizes.  Your score will be identical to the sum total of what your recorded plays earned creators.
