[Solomode](./announcement-solomode.md) needs you to play solo modes!  The most important time for you to do this is Derby.  The most important thing for you to do is properly record these plays in variant threads, one discrete post per play.

## Important Dates
* Line Up - **December 17, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022**

## Derby
Wait.  What's Derby?

Derby is a drag race between solo modes.  Solo mode creators are building them.  Their racecars (solo modes, of course!) will be lined up and the race will begin in January 2022.  You have the entire month of January to record your solo mode plays to score creators' points needed to fuel the outcome!

## Line Up
There are several [categories](./categories.md) to be filled will solo modes.  The line up will begin forming in December and finalize come the 17th.

## Participation
To ensure your plays are credited to creators, if you participate, please read the [Players' Guide](./players-guide.md).

Mark your calendars or subscribe to this thread.  Creators may invite you to play test early releases announced here.
