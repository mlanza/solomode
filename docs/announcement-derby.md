[Solomode](https://urlday.cc/fgdvt) invites you to play solo modes!  The most important time to do this is Derby.  The most important thing for you to do is properly record yours plays.

Wait.  Derby?

## Derby
Derby is a drag race between solo modes.  Solo mode creators are building them.  Their race cars (solo modes, of course!) will be lined up and the gun fired **January 1, 2022**.  The race will ensue until the end of January when your your plays will be tallied and the winners decided!

## Line Up
The [line up](https://urlday.cc/l3abt) will begin filling with solo modes in December.  In preparation you should be looking them over and learning the rules for the ones you want to play.

## Participation
The race cars are fueled by your participation.   Solo mode creators covet and appreciate your support.

See the [Players' Guide](https://urlday.cc/1cdof) for more detail on what you need to do.
