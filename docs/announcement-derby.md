## Derby
Derby is a drag race between solo modes.  Solo mode creators are building them.  Their race cars (solo modes, of course!) will be lined up and the gun fired **January 1, 2022**.  The race will ensue until the end of January when your your plays will be tallied and the winners decided!

## Line Up

## Participation
The race cars are fueled by your participation.   Solo mode creators covet and appreciate your support.
