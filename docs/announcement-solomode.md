[Solomode](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2540440/2020-solomode-design-contest) is back!

It's time for content creators to roll up their sleeves and get to creating solo modes for their beloved games.

If you've ever pondered "could I make a board game," participation in Solomode is a small step in that direction.  Last year's participants agreed.  [Creating a solo mode](./creators-guide.md) is an ideal first step for budding and hopeful game designers.  It dramatically shortens prototyping by providing you with most of the materials you need in a single box!

Wait.  What's Solomode?  Well, as the name implies, it's about solo modes—ones you create and enter into friendly competition.  These solo modes are revealed in a [Line Up](./categories.md).  Solo mode enthusiasts will chose and learn them.  You'll earn points during [Derby](./announcement-derby.md) every time someone plays your solo mode.

Winners will be announced once Derby concludes.

Hopefully this whets your appetite for things to come and gives you [enough information](./creators-guide.md) to get started with the early stages of your design.

The contest is a two-sided coin:
* Solomode — the back-end contest for creators (see [Creators' Guide](./creators-guide.md))
* Derby — the front-end main event for players (see [Players' Guide](./players-guide.md))

## Important Dates
* Registration - **December 1 - December 14, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022**

## Sponsorship
[Sponsors can put up prizes](./sponsors-guide.md) for one or more categories in exchange for ads.
