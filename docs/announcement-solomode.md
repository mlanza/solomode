[Solomode](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2540440/2020-solomode-design-contest) is back!

It's time for content creators to roll up their sleeves and get to creating solo modes for their beloved games.

If you've ever pondered making a board game, participation in Solomode is a small step in that direction.  Last year's participants agreed.  [Creating a solo mode](https://urlday.cc/w2474) is an ideal first step for budding and hopeful game designers.  It dramatically shortens prototyping by providing you with most of the materials you need in a single box!

Wait.  Solomode?

Well, as the name implies, it's about solo modes—ones you create and enter into friendly competition.  These solo modes are revealed in a [Line Up](https://urlday.cc/l3abt).  Solo mode enthusiasts will chose and learn them.  You'll earn points during [Derby](https://urlday.cc/z1luy) every time someone plays your solo mode.

Winners will be announced once Derby concludes.

Hopefully this whets your appetite for things to come and gives you [enough information](https://urlday.cc/w2474) to get started with the early stages of your design.

The contest is a coin:
* Heads — Derby is for players (see [Players' Guide](https://urlday.cc/1cdof))
