It's time for content creators to roll up their sleeves and get to creating solo modes for their beloved games.

If you've ever pondered making a board game, participation in Solomode is a small step in that direction.  Last year's participants agreed.  [url=https://urlday.cc/w2474]Creating a solo mode[/url] is an ideal first step for budding and hopeful game designers.  It dramatically shortens prototyping by providing you with most of the materials you need in a single box!

Wait.  Solomode?

Well, as the name implies, it's about solo modes—ones you create and enter into friendly competition.  These solo modes are revealed in a [url=https://urlday.cc/l3abt]Line Up[/url].  Solo mode enthusiasts will chose and learn them.  You'll earn points during [url=https://urlday.cc/z1luy]Derby[/url] every time someone plays your solo mode.

Winners will be announced once Derby concludes.

Hopefully this whets your appetite for things to come and gives you [url=https://urlday.cc/w2474]enough information[/url] to get started with the early stages of your design.

The contest is a coin:
• Heads — Derby is for players (see [url=https://urlday.cc/1cdof]Players' Guide[/url])
