Solomode is back.

It's time for content creators to roll up their sleeves and get to creating solo modes for their beloved games.

That creating a solo mode is an ideal first step for budding and hopeful game designers was the strong sentiment of last year's participants.  So if you've long wondered, "am I cut out to make board games," Solomode is an opportunity to take a step in that direction.

The key dates are on the horizon.

## Important Events
* Registration - **December 1 - December 14, 2021**
* Derby - **January 2022** (plays are scored only in this month)

The earliness of this announcement is meant only to whet your appetite for things to come and to give you enough information to get started with the early stages of your design.

Wait.  What's Solomode?  Well, as the name implies, it's about solo modes—ones you create and enter into friendly competition.  These solo modes are later revealed in Solomode Derby.

Derby is for board game and solo mode enthusiasts.  Eager players scan solo mode geeklists, choose intersting offerings—and play them!  That's it.
