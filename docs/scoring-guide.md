# Solomode 2021 Scoring Guide
Solomode is divided into categories (e.g. different events/geeklists) in which a solo mode may compete.  Each category provides guidelines for an appropriate entry (at the top of the respective geeklist) and is scored separately.

## Categories
*These categories have not yet been determined, but there will be approximately 6.*

## Scoring
Recorded plays earn points plus bonuses for both solo modes (added to the submission scoreboard) and players who record plays (added to the player scoreboard).

Every recorded play earns:
* 1 point

Every recorded play earns bonus points when new players play a solo mode:
* 7 points - first new player
* 6 points - second new player
* 5 points - third new player
* 4 points - every new player thereafter

Read [Solomode Player's Guide](./players-guide.md) to understand recorded plays.  Basically, the more a solo mode is played, the better its score.  *Solo mode players earn as many points and their plays garner the solo modes they played.*

## Scoreboards
Each category is scored separately and has its own publicly displayed, periodically updated scoreboard.  When the race concludes a final snapshot will immortalize the results and winners will receive whatever prizes were made available to the category.  Listed prizes will be awarded only in categories in which at least 5 entrants clear registration.

*While plays can be recorded anytime only those recorded during the **Derby** are scored.*  Scoreboards, periodically, updated, will be posted giving a glimpse of the race as it progresses.  Ties favor the solo mode with the earliest play on record.

## Example
Within the *45 Minutes Or Less* category are 7 submissions:

### Submission Scoreboard
1. Catan Unplugged (Latisha) = 47
1. Scythe: The Rescue (Tony) = 39
1. Kandee Krush (Martin) = 36
1. ..
1. ..
1. ..
1. ..

Here are the plays recorded in Martin's submission thread (points and bonuses denoted):

### [Solomode 2021] Kandee Krush
1. Sadie — 8 (1 + 7)
1. Sadie — 1
1. Sadie — 1
1. Latisha — 7 (1 + 6)
1. Joseph — 6 (1 + 5)
1. Sadie — 1
1. Haruo — 5 (1 + 4)
1. Joseph — 1
1. Leopold — 5 (1 + 4)
1. Joseph — 1

Here is the slice of the scores earned from activity on *Kandee Krush*:

### Player Scoreboard
1. Sadie = 11
1. Joseph = 8
1. Latisha = 7
1. Haruo = 5
1. Leopold = 5

In the broader scheme these numbers are incomplete because players may have earned points from their activity in other solo mode threads within the category.  So while Sadie had earned more points playing Kandee Krush, Haruo was busy grabbing the best available bonuses on other solo modes.  And factoring those scores in, he maintains a wide lead within the category.
