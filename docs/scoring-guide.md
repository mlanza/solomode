# Solomode 2021 Scoring Guide
Solomode is divided into categories (e.g. different events/geeklists) in which a solo mode may compete.  Each category provides guidelines for an appropriate entry (at the top of the respective geeklist) and is scored separately.  

## Categories
*These categories have not yet been determined, but there will be approximately 5.*

## Scoring
Registered plays earn points plus bonuses for both solo modes (added to the solo mode scoreboard) and players who registered  plays (added to the player scoreboard).

Every registered play earns:
* 1 point

Every registered play earns bonus points when new players play a solo mode:
* 7 points - first new player
* 6 points - second new player
* 5 points - third new player
* 4 points - every new player thereafter

Read [Solomode Player's Guide](./players-guide.md) to understand registered plays.  Basically, the more a solo mode is played, the better its score.  *Solo mode players earn as many points and their plays garner the solo modes they played.*

## Scoreboards
Each category is scored separately and has its own publicly displayed, periodically updated scoreboard.  When the race concludes a final snapshot will immortalize the results and winners will receive whatever prizes were made available to the category.  Listed prizes will be awared only in categories in which at least 5 entrants clear registration.

*While votes can be cast anytime only those cast during the **Derby** are scored.*  Scoreboards, periodically, updated, will be posted giving a glimpse of the race as it progresses.  Ties favor the solo mode with the earliest registered vote.

## Example
Martin's solo mode, Kandee Krush, records the following registered plays (points and bonuses noted):
1. Sadie — 8 (1 + 7)
1. Sadie — 1
1. Sadie — 1
1. Latisha — 7 (1 + 6)
1. Joseph — 6 (1 + 5)
1. Sadie — 1
1. Haruo — 5 (1 + 4)
1. Joseph — 1
1. Leopold — 5 (1 + 4)
1. Joseph — 1

Solo mode scoreboard:
1. Catan Unplugged (Latisha) = 57
1. Scythe: The Rescue (Tony) = 43
1. Kandee Krush (Martin) = 40
1. ..
1. ..
1. ..
1. ..

Player scoreboard:
1. Sadie = 11
1. Joseph = 8
1. Latisha = 7
1. Haruo = 5
1. Leopold = 5

This solo mode's score represents a single slice of the overall player scoreboard.  Players earns points for all the solo modes they play in a category.  In this category there are 7.  So while Martin's currently ranks third he still has hopes over overtaking Tony.

So while Sadie's Kandee Krush score is better than Haruo's, he's played 4 of the 7 solo modes and maintains a wide lead on the overall player scoreboard.
