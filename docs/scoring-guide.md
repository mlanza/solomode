# 2021 Solomode Scoring Guide
Solomode has [categories](./categories.md) in which solo modes may compete.  Each lists requirements for appropriate submissions and each is scored as a separate event.

## Scoring
Recorded plays earn points plus bonuses for both solo modes (added to the submission scoreboard) and players who record plays (added to the player scoreboard).  The Choo Choo category has its own scoring bonus.

Every play recorded earns:
* 1 point

Every play recorded by a new player earns bonus points:
* 7 points - first new player
* 6 points - second new player
* 5 points - third new player
* 4 points - every new player thereafter

Thus, the more a submission is played, the better its score.

Read the [Player's Guide](./players-guide.md) to learn how to record plays.

## Scoreboards
Each category is scored separately and has its own publicly displayed, periodically updated scoreboard.  When the race concludes a final snapshot will immortalize the results.  **If the category is sponsored and has at least 5 contestants** prizes will be awarded to **the winner** and **the runner up**.

*While plays occuring outside **Derby** should be recorded as usual only those recorded during it are counted.*  Scoreboards, periodically, updated, will be posted giving a glimpse of the race as it progresses.

## Tiebreaking
Ties are broken in favor of the earliest Derby play on record.
