Solomode is back.

It's time for content creators to roll up their sleeves and get to creating solo modes for their beloved games.  Last year's participants almost unanimously agreed creating a solo mode is an ideal first step for budding and hopeful game designers.

The key dates are over the horizon.  The earliness of this announcement is meant to whet your appetite for things to come and to give you enough information to get started with the early stages of your design.

What's Solomode?  Well, as the name implies, it's about solo modes—ones you create and enter into friendly competition.  These solo modes are later revealed in Solomode Derby.

Derby is for board game and solo mode enthusiasts.  Eager players scan solo mode geeklists, choose intersting offerings—and play them!  Well there's a bit more, but not much.  See the Players' Guide.

That's it.  Two sides of a coin:
* Solomode — see Creators' Guide
* Solomode Derby — see Players' Guide
