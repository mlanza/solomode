[b][u]2021 SOLOMODE SPONSORS' GUIDE[/u][/b]
[url=https://urlday.cc/fgdvt]Solomode[/url] is a competition for solo mode creators which culminates in [url=https://urlday.cc/z1luy]Derby[/url], a plays-fueled race over which their solo modes are scored.

There are [url=https://urlday.cc/l3abt]6 categories[/url] in which creators can compete as well as a separate Players' Scoreboard where players can compete.  So in total that's 7 sponsorship slots:
• [geeklist=289677]Chop Chop[/geeklist]
• [geeklist=289678]Chronobot[/geeklist]
• [geeklist=289679]Write-ins[/geeklist]
• [geeklist=289680]Choo Choo[/geeklist]
• [geeklist=289681]Toddler[/geeklist]
• [geeklist=289682]Freestyle[/geeklist]
• Players' Scoreboard

If your venture, commercial or otherwise, is community appropriate, your opportunity is this: provide around $150 for two prizes for a sponsored slot.  The winning prize would be valued at around $100 and the runner up prize around $50.  Shipping, if applicable, must be covered too.

As international shipping rates can sometimes exceed the value of shipped contents, You may make exception for international winners by offering equivalent-value gift cards instead.

In return for your sponsorship, [b]you provide a short ad[/b], the kind one would typically find on web sites embedded between content or in the sidebar.  It can be a graphic (or just plain text) and it can be linked to the web page of your choice.  Please contact me via geekmail.  Offers will be responded to in the order they are received.

Solomode runs from now until end of January 2022 so that's a substantial window of advertising at not much cost.  And just in time for the holidays!

[b]Prizes need only be awarded if at least 5 individuals compete in the sponsored category.  This would happen in February 2022.[/b]

[i]BGG has pre-approved this sponsorship opportunity.[/i]
