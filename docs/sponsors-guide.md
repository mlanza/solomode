# Solomode 2021 Sponsors' Guide
Solomode is a competition for solo mode creators which culminates in Derby, a plays-fueled race over which these solo modes are scored.

There are [6 categories](./categories.md) in which creators can compete as well as a separate players' scoreboard where players can compete.  So in total that's 7 sponsorship slots:
* Chop Chop category
* Chronobot category
* Write-ins category
* Choo Choo category
* Toddler category
* Freestyle category
* Players' scoreboard

If your venture, commercial or otherwise, is appropriate for this community, your opportunity is this.  Provide around $150 for two prizes for a sponsored slot.  The winning prize would be valued at around $100 and the runner up prize around $50.  Shipping, if applicable, must be covered too.  You may make exception for international shipping by offering gift cards instead as international rates may sometimes exceed the value of the prizes themselves.

In return for your sponsorship you may provide a short ad, the kind one would typically find on web sites embeded between content or in the sidebar.  It can be a graphic (or just plain text) and it can be linked to the website of your choice.  Please contact me via geekmail.  I will respond to offers in the order they are received.

Solomode runs from now until end of January 2022 so that's a substantial advertising window for not much cost.  And right around the holidays!

Prizes need only be awared if at least 5 individuals compete in the sponsored category.
